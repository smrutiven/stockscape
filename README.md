# Dashboard for Stock Price vs Revenue Comparison
Overview:
This project involves the creation of a dashboard using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Plotly in a Jupyter notebook environment. As a data scientist employed at an investment firm, the task was to extract revenue data for two companies, Tesla and GameStop, and build a dashboard to compare their stock prices with their respective revenue trends.

Project Components:
1. Data Extraction: Utilized web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup to extract revenue data for Tesla and GameStop from relevant sources.
2. Data Analysis and Visualization: Processed and analyzed the extracted revenue data using Pandas to calculate revenue trends over time.
3. Created interactive visualizations using Plotly to represent the stock price and revenue trends of Tesla and GameStop.
4. Dashboard Creation: Integrated the visualizations into a dashboard format using Plotly Dash, allowing for easy comparison of stock prices and revenue trends for both companies.
5. Project Outcome: The resulting dashboard provides a clear and intuitive comparison between the stock prices and revenue trends of Tesla and GameStop. Users can easily visualize and analyze the relationship between these two variables, aiding investment decisions and market analysis.

Files Included:
1. dashboard.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data extraction, analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.
